        <h2>Welcome to Ontario's Jumping Spider Community</h2>
        <p>
          Ontario is home to an incredible diversity of jumping spiders
          (Salticidae), each with unique behaviors and adaptations. These tiny
          acrobats of the arachnid world captivate with their intelligence,
          vibrant colors, and remarkable hunting skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes jumping spiders special? Their exceptional vision (with
          eyes that can see in nearly 360 degrees), complex courtship dances,
          and ability to leap up to 50 times their body length set them apart
          from other spiders.
        </p>
        <p>

      <h2>Jumping Spider Facts & Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          🕷️ They don't spin webs to catch prey instead, they actively hunt
          using excellent vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          🦶 They don't walk like typical spiders instead of the unsettling
          clumsy glide many spiders have, jumping spiders move in short,
          deliberate, almost robotic steps, which many people find less creepy.
        </li>
        <li>
          👀 They have incredible eyesight — 8 eyes total, with two large
          front-facing eyes that provide sharp, binocular vision. Unlike most
          spiders (which have 6 forward-facing eyes), jumping spiders have only
          4 facing forward. The other 4 are spaced along the sides and back of
          the head, giving them nearly 360° awareness. Their large central eyes
          also give them a surprisingly expressive, almost human look.
        </li>
        <li>
          🐜 They can jump up to 50 times their body length using hydraulic
          pressure in their legs.
        </li>
        <li>🌍 Found worldwide over 6,000 species in diverse environments.</li>
        <li>
          🧠 Surprisingly curious they can learn, remember, and even recognize
          human faces.
        </li>
        <li>
          😌 Very shy and rarely bite their venom is not harmful to humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          🎨 Many are beautifully patterned from metallic sheens to bold
          stripes.
        </li>
        <li>
          🕸️ They do spin silk to create draglines, retreats, and egg sacs.
        </li>
        <li>
          💃 Males perform elaborate dances often with leg waves and body
          vibrations to impress females.
        </li>
        <li>
          📏 Tiny but bold most range from 1 to 25 mm but are active, curious,
          and fearless.
        </li>
        <li>
          🌿 You can often find them on sunny surfaces like garden walls,
          fences, tree bark, or even inside homes.
        </li>
        <li>
          🤲 To handle one let it walk onto your hand gently; avoid quick
          movements and never trap it under a cup. Be careful not to squish
          them, as they are delicate creatures.
        </li>
      </ul>
